# Web3 Card game

<p>Hey guys, Khanisic/Abdul Moid Khan here 👋.</p>
<br/>
<p>Welcome to the AVAXGods Web3 Card game where you can battle your friends and test out who has that higher IQ among your friends. This game gets random at every round of action and each player is dealt with a hand it may or may not wish to see.</p>
<br/>
<p>I have used <i>Vite.js react framework,</i> to build the project deployed it on vercel. For the smart contract deployment, I've used hardhat and used MATIC to power the smart contract!</p>
